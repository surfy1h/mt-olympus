# exchange
My implementation of a performant exchange

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and `docker-compose` installed.

### Installation
Installation is very simple, simply clone the repo.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/themarkrizkallah/exchange.git
```

### Running the project
Go to the project directory (`exchange/`) and run:
```
$ docker-compose up --build
```

Once the containers are up and running, you can make API calls to the front-end server on `localhost:8080`

For more information, consult *front_end_server*'s [README](./front_end_server/README.md)

### Comments
The project is in very early stages, expect most of this documentation and code to change.
